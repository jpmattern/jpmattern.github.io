It is based on popular diagnostics that utilize differences between observations and prior and posterior model solutions at the observation locations. In the application to a data assimilation system that combines a three-dimensional, physical-biogeochemical ocean model with large datasets of physical and chlorophyll a observations, the tuning procedure leads to a decrease in the posterior model-observation misfit and small improvements in short-term forecasting skill. It also increases the consistency of the data assimilation system with respect to diagnostics, based on linear estimation theory, and reduces signs of overfitting. The tuning procedure is easy to implement and only relies on information that is either prescribed to the data assimilation system or can be obtained from a series of short data assimilation experiments. The implementation includes a lognormal representation for biogeochemical variables and associated modifications to the diagnostics. Furthermore, the effect of the length of the observation window (number and distribution of observations) used to compute the diagnostics and the effect of neglecting model dynamics in the tuning procedure are examined.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Variational Data Assimilation through Background and Observation Error Adjustments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536476400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536476400,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://www.paulmattern.org/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

Yet much still needs to be learned about important aspects of biogeochemical data assimilation, such as the effect of model complexity and the importance of more realistic model formulations on assimilation results. In this study, 4D-Var-based state estimation is applied to two biogeochemical ocean models: a simple NPZD model with 4 biogeochemical variables (including 1 phytoplankton, 1 zooplankton) and the more complex NEMURO model, containing 11 biogeochemical variables (including 2 phytoplankton, 3 zooplankton). Both models are coupled to a 3-dimensional physical ocean circulation model of the U.S. west coast based on the Re- gional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS). Chlorophyll satellite observations and physical observations are assimilated into the model, yielding substantial improvements in state estimates for the observed physi- cal and biogeochemical variables in both model formulations. In comparison to the simpler NPZD model, NEMURO shows a better overall fit to the observations. The assimilation also results in small improve- ments for simulated nitrate concentrations in both models and no apparent degradation of the output for other unobserved variables. The forecasting skill of the biogeochemical models is strongly linked to model performance without data assimilation: for both models, the improved fit obtained through assimilation degrades at similar relative rates, but drops to different absolute levels. Despite the better performance of NEMURO in our experiments, the choice of model and desired level of complexity should depend on the model application and the data available for assimilation.","tags":[],"title":"Data assimilation of physical and chlorophyll a observations in the California Current System using two biogeochemical models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jann Paul Mattern","Christopher A.

However, 3-dimensional ocean model simulations are computationally expensive and models typically contain upwards of 10 parameters suitable for estimation. Hence, manual parameter tuning can be lengthy and cumbersome. Here, we present four easy to implement and flexible parameter estimation techniques and apply them to two 3-dimensional biogeochemical models of different complexities. Based on a Monte Carlo experiment, we first develop a cost function measuring the model-observation misfit based on multiple data types. The parameter estimation techniques are then applied and yield a substantial cost reduction over ∼ 100 simulations. Based on the outcome of multiple replicate experiments, they perform on average better than random, uninformed parameter search but performance declines when more than 40 parameters are estimated together. Our results emphasize the complex cost function structure for biogeochemical parameters and highlight dependencies between different parameters as well as different cost function formulations.","tags":[],"title":"Simple parameter estimation for complex models — Testing evolutionary techniques on 3-dimensional biogeochemical ocean models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The onset of this event has been explained from bottom-up and top-down perspectives, exemplified by the ‘‘critical-depth'' and the ‘‘dilution-recoupling'' hypotheses, respectively. Both approaches differ in their key expectations about how seasonal fluctuations of the mixed layer affect the plankton community. Here we assess whether the assumptions inherent to these hypotheses are met inside a typical onedi- mensional Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus (NPZD) model, optimized to best represent climatological annual cycles of satellite-based phytoplankton biomass in the Subpolar North Atlantic. The optimized model is used in idealized experiments that isolate the effects of mixed layer fluctuations and zooplankton grazing, in order to elucidate their significance. We analyzed the model sensitivity qual- itatively and using a second-order Taylor series decomposition of the model equations. Our results show that the conceptual bases of both bottom-up and top-down approaches are required to explain the pro- cess of blooming; however, neither of their bloom initiation mechanisms fully applies in the experiments. We find that a spring bloom can develop in the absence of mixed layer fluctuations, and both its magni- tude and timing seem to strongly depend on nutrient and light availability. Furthermore, although zoo- plankton populations modulate the phytoplankton concentrations throughout the year, directly prescribed and physically driven changes in zooplankton grazing do not produce significant time shifts in bloom initiation, as hypothesized. While recognizing its limitations, our study emphasizes the processes that require further testing in order to discern among competing hypotheses.","tags":[],"title":"Model investigations of the North Atlantic spring bloom initiation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jann Paul Mattern","Katja Fennel","Michael Dowd"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1414800000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1414800000,"objectID":"89561321db4e93bd72d0e5b76db30ff0","permalink":"https://www.paulmattern.org/publication/dal_emulator2/","publishdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dal_emulator2/","section":"publication","summary":"Using two emulator-based procedures, we estimate time-dependent values for two key plankton parameters in a three-dimensional biogeochemical (BGC) ocean model.

The model simulates the major physical and biological processes involved in the formation of the hypoxic zone that develops on the shelf every summer. With the help of a statistical emulator technique, we introduced uncertainty in selected model inputs and assessed the effects of these uncertainties on the predicted development and spatial distribution of bottom hypoxia. The uncertain inputs we examined belong to two categories: (i) biological inputs including river nutrient concentration, phytoplankton growth rate and initial and boundary conditions of biological variables, and (ii) physical inputs including freshwater river runoff, wind forcing, and mixing coefficients. We show that uncertainty in different inputs has distinct effects on model output which vary in magnitude, time, and space.

Here representations ranging from simple parameterizations to vertically resolved diagenetic models are compared against a comprehensive, multi-year data set from a mesocosm eutrophication study. Observations of sediment-water fluxes of nutrients and oxygen and measurements of the state of the overlying water column were made over 2.5 years in nine mesocosms, six of which received geometrically increasing loads of inorganic nutrients. These observations are used here to force and optimize two simple parameterizations of sediment oxygen uptake, one representative two-layer diagenetic model and one representative multi-layer diagenetic model. In cross-validation experiments the predictive ability of these different representations is compared. The main results are that the optimized multi-layer model fits the observations best and also proved to be the most parsimonious, while the two-layer model failed the cross-validation indicating that it is prone to over-fitting and was less parsimonious even than one of the simpler functional oxygen flux models.

Particle Filters represent an alternative to other, more commonly used ensemble-based state estimation techniques like the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Unlike the EnKF, Particle Filters do not require normality assumptions about the model error structure and are thus suitable for highly nonlinear applications. However, their application in oceanographic contexts is typically hampered by the high dimensionality of the model's state space. We apply SIR to a high-dimensional model with a small ensemble size (20) and modify the standard SIR procedure to avoid complications posed by the high dimensionality of the model state. Two extensions to the SIR include a simple smoother to deal with outliers in the observations, and state- augmentation which provides the SIR with parameter memory. Our goal is to test the feasibility of biological state estimation with SIR for realistic models. For this purpose we compare the SIR results to a model simulation with optimal parameters with respect to the same set of observations. By running replicates of our main experiments, we assess the robustness of our SIR implementation. We show that SIR is suitable for satellite data assimilation into biological models and that both extensions, the smoother and state- augmentation, are required for robust results and improved fit to the observations.","tags":[],"title":"Particle filter-based data assimilation for a three-dimensional biological ocean model and satellite observations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jann Paul Mattern","Katja Fennel","Michael Dowd"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1343779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1343779200,"objectID":"f3288cab308e5988bf1238083d1c3918","permalink":"https://www.paulmattern.org/publication/dal_emulator1/","publishdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dal_emulator1/","section":"publication","summary":"We use a statistical emulator technique, the polynomial chaos expansion, to estimate time-dependent values for two parameters of a 3-dimensional biological ocean model. We obtain values for the phytoplankton carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio and the zooplankton grazing rate by minimizing the misfit between simulated and satellite-based surface chlorophyll. The misfit is measured by a spatially averaged, time-dependent dis- tance function. A cross-validation experiment demonstrates that the influence of outlying satellite data can be diminished by smoothing the distance function in time. The optimal values of the two parameters based on the smoothed distance function exhibit a strong time-dependence with distinct seasonal differences, without overfitting observations. Using these time-dependent parameters, we derive (hindcast) state esti- mates in two distinct ways: (1) by using the emulator-based interpolation and (2) by performing model runs with time-dependent parameters. Both approaches yield chlorophyll state estimates that agree better with the observations than model estimates with globally optimal, constant parameters. Moreover, the em- ulator approach provides us with estimates ofparameter-induced model state uncertainty, which help deter- mine at what time improvement in the model simulation is possible. The time-dependence of the analyzed parameters can be motivated biologically by naturally occurring seasonal changes in the composition of the plankton community. Our results suggest that the parameter values of typical biological ocean models should be treated as time-dependent and will result in a better representation of plankton dynamics in these models.

In this study we introduce and compare various measures for the quantitative comparison of satellite images and model output that have not been used in this context before. We devised a series of test to compare their performance, including their sensitivity to noise and missing values, which are ubiquitous in satellite images. Our results show that two of our adapted measures, the Adapted Gray Block distance and the entropic distance D2, perform better than the commonly used root mean square error and image correlation.","tags":[],"title":"Introduction and Assessment of Measures for Quantitative Model-Data Comparison Using Satellite Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jann Paul Mattern","Michael Dowd","Katja Fennel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"e8334fa180367549ef699895c8b179dc","permalink":"https://www.paulmattern.org/publication/dal_masters/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dal_masters/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, we investigate sequential data assimilation approaches for state estimation and prediction in a coupled physical–biological model for the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) site. The model is 1- dimensional (vertical) in space and based on the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM). Coupled to GOTM is a biological model that includes phytoplankton, detritus, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, chlorophyll and oxygen. We performed model ensemble runs by introducing variations in the biological parameters, each of which was assigned a probability distribution. We compare and contrast here 2 sequential data assimilation methods: the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and sequential importance resampling (SIR). We assimilated different types of BATS observations, including particulate organic nitrogen, nitrate+nitrite, chlorophyll a and oxygen for the 2-year period from January 1990 to December 1991, and quantified the impact of the data assimilation on the model's predictive skill. By applying a cross-validation to the data- assimilative and deterministic simulations we found that the predictive skill was improved for 2-week forecasts. In our experiments the EnKF, which exhibited a stronger effect on the ensemble during the assimilation step, showed slightly higher improvements in the predictive skill than the SIR, which preserves dynamical model consistency in our implementation. Our numerical experiments show that statistical properties stabilize for ensemble sizes of 20 or greater with little improvement for larger ensembles.","tags":[],"title":"Sequential data assimilation applied to a physical-biological model for the Bermuda Atlantic time series station","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
